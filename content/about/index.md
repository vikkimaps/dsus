<h3> Summary </h3>
This module will provide a foundation in data science training, introducing concepts in data handling, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and visualisation. The course will provide students with opportunities to work with a variety of spatial and spatiotemporal datasets relating to urban systems (e.g. transport data, demographics, morphologies). The course will embed good practice in data science production through code notebooks, and in open science methods (e.g. through GitHub). The course will aim to become language agnostic, but beginning by providing code and opportunities to submit assessments in a specified programming language, which will allow students to shape their learning to match optional course requirements.

  
<h3> Module Objectives </h3>
This module will introduce students to urban data science, providing a thorough foundation of data sets, analytics and applications across a diverse range of contemporary urban contexts. It will develop an understanding of the appropriate steps and techniques for effective data processing and visualisation, fostering independence and confidence in coding though practical approaches, utilising notebooks and open science methods![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77619683/118994848-93b40b00-b97e-11eb-9162-42b6e11aa85f.png)
  

<h3> Learning Outcomes </h3>
Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:
<ul> 
  <li> Understand and apply all steps of data handling and analytics, including wrangling, description, analysis, machine learning and visualisation </li>
  <li> Understand the core concepts and applications of regression, clustering and classification methods and machine learning techniques, to identify and perform the appropriate implementation of each </li>
  <li> Become comfortable working with a range of non-spatial, spatial, and temporal datasets, understanding their application to a range of different urban systems </li>
  <li> Be able to select and perform appropriate visualisations according to the data, and utilise these to clearly present their data and findings </li>
  <li> Be proficient in creating and presenting comprehensive code notebooks in Python </li>
<li> Understand the benefits and practical applications of working with and creating their own open science methods </li>
</ul>
  
<h3> Assessment </h3>
The summative assessment for this module consists of:
<ul>
  <li> <b> 20%: </b> 2 x data science tasks </li>
  <li> <b> 80%: </b> project notebook </li>
</ul>
